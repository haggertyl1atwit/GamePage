                    Rock Paper Scissors: Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka "Ro-Sham-Bo", janken,
                    "Bato, Bato, Pick" and "Scissors, Paper, Stone") is a simple hand 
                    game that is played around the world, with many different names
                    and variations. It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions,
                    and in some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that
                    competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an
                    agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object”
                    is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock Paper Scissors
                    is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no obvious
                    advantage to the stronger, older, more experienced opponent.
                    A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who
                    has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts
                    scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper
                    covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors 
                    ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the 
                    game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

                    Craps: In a single roll of the dice, there are a number of combinations
                    in which a player can wager. There is the main game, known as the
                    “Pass Line” and “Don’t Pass” line, but there are many different
                    combinations where you can try and predict how the dice will land.
